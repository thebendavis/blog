title: About Me
slug: about

My name is Ben Davis.
I'm an applied computer security and mobile systems researcher.
I build software that allows us to better understand and control the systems on which we depend.

## Research

I have led the following research projects:

* [**RetroSkeleton**]({filename}/retroskeleton-android-app-rewriting-overview.md): an Android app rewriting system that automatically enforces security policies, patches vulnerabilities, and augments functionality in real-world Android apps. This project included the development of a static analysis and sophisticated bytecode transformation framework for Android apps, exploring dynamic behavior of apps via automated emulator-based testing, and detection and thwarting of malware.
* [**Privacy-Preserving Alibi Systems**]({filename}/privacy-preserving-alibi-systems-overview.md): design and implementation of cryptographic schemes that enable mobile device users to provide evidence of their past locations while retaining control of their privacy
* [**DBTaint**]({filename}/dbtaint-database-information-flow-tracking-overview.md): a cross-application end-to-end [information flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_flow_%28information_theory%29) tracking system for modern web services and databases, protecting real-world web apps from cross-site scripting and other code-injection attacks

See the linked project pages for more detail and slides for conference presentations I've given.


## Industry

My work in industry includes:

* Development of protocol-level security mechanisms for [SCADA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA) systems and microcontroller-based implementations of these mechanisms
* Vulnerability assessments of critical infrastructure networks and hardware
* Security evaluation and penetration testing of cloud computing environments
* Applying formal methods to model, prove properties, and uncover flaws in digital systems


## Academic

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science
at the [University of California, Davis](http://ucdavis.edu/)
where I was advised by Professor [Hao Chen](http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~hchen/)
in the [Computer Security Lab](http://seclab.cs.ucdavis.edu/).

I am the primary researcher and author of the following security and privacy work:
